Description

PF is a full-stack web application combining a modern front-end built with React and a custom back-end Python API server. It’s designed to illustrate a complete “client + server” architecture, where the React UI calls your own RESTful (or similar) API for data, providing modularity, scalability, and separation of concerns.
This README documents how to install, run, and contribute to the project. It also explains the motivation, architecture, and structure after merging the two repos.

Features

Client-side UI built with React.js — modular components, state management, routing (if applicable), responsive design, etc.

Back-end API server for data provision — supports CRUD operations, authentication/authorization (if implemented), data persistence, etc.

Clear separation between client and server — easier to maintain, test, deploy separately.

Easy local setup and configuration for both client and server.
